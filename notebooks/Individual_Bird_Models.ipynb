{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# üê¶ Bird Presence Detection with MobileNetV2 + Augmented Data Pipeline\n","\n","This notebook builds **binary classifiers** for detecting the presence of specific bird species, focusing particularly on **rare species not seen in BirdNET classes**. Each classifier is trained separately per species using class balancing, heavy augmentations, and overlapping-vocalization simulation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üîë Pipeline Overview\n","\n","### 1. Data Preparation\n","- Start from processed splits (`train_filenames.npy`, `val_filenames.npy`, etc.).\n","- Oversample target bird samples up to the count of the most frequent species.\n","- Add equal number of **non-bird** or **other bird** samples ‚Üí balanced binary dataset.\n","- Optionally inject **soundscape** samples for robustness.\n","\n","### 2. Data Generator (`AudioFeatureGeneratorMixedPadded`)\n","- Loads 5s audio chunks at 32 kHz.\n","- Applies waveform-level augmentations:\n","  - Reverb, compression, clipping\n","  - Pitch shifting, time-stretch, random shifting\n","  - Volume scaling, noise mixing\n","- Applies mixing-based augmentations:\n","  - **Target bird + soundscape**\n","  - **Bird + other birds** (same or different species)\n","  - **Bird + random noise**\n","- Converts audio chunks into Mel spectrograms:\n","  - Scaled to [0, 1]\n","  - Padded/truncated to fixed length\n","  - Expanded to 3 channels (RGB-style for CNNs)\n","- Optional **SpecAugment** applied (time/frequency masking).\n","\n","### 3. Dataset Construction (`create_dataset`)\n","- Produces balanced `train_generator` and `val_generator`.\n","- Wraps them into TensorFlow `tf.data.Dataset` objects for efficient streaming.\n","- Ensures:\n","  - Shuffling in training\n","  - Deterministic loading in validation\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üéØ Model: MobileNetV2 Bird Presence Classifier\n","- Base network: **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet-pretrained)** with global average pooling.\n","- Classification head:\n","  - Dense (512 units, ReLU + Dropout 0.5)\n","  - Dense (1 unit, sigmoid) ‚Üí binary output\n","- L2 regularization applied to Dense layers.\n","- Option to fine-tune (base layers trainable or frozen).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üß™ Training Strategy\n","- **Loss**: Binary Crossentropy\n","- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=5e-4)\n","- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1 (custom callback)\n","- **Callbacks**:\n","  - `ValidationF1Callback`: evaluates F1 on validation set each epoch, saves best model + score.\n","  - `EarlyStopping`: stops if validation loss does not improve for N epochs, restoring best weights.\n","  - `LambdaCallback`: prints batch-level metrics (loss, precision, recall).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üöÄ Training Loop\n","- For each **target bird** in the dataset:\n","  - Create train/val datasets for that species.\n","  - Build and fine-tune a MobileNetV2-based binary classifier.\n","  - Save the best model per species (`best_model_<bird_id>.keras`).\n","  - Track best F1 in `best_val_f1_<bird_id>.txt`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes\n","- Robust binary classifiers trained per species:\n","  - Handle **class imbalance** via oversampling.\n","  - Handle **background noise + environment** via augmentation.\n","  - Handle **overlapping calls** via mixing with soundscapes and other birds.\n","- Final models are bird-specific detectors that can generalize to noisy, real-world audio.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iwwLMJsaGZ16"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#
