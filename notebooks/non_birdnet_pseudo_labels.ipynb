Originally Discluded**\n","\n","This section addresses the issue that the original sliding window inference code did not process audio files shorter than the sliding window length (5 seconds) properly, resulting in missing predictions for these shorter files.\n","\n","- The variable `unused_files` identifies which audio files from the dataset have not been processed yet by comparing all files with those already used in `final_df`.\n","\n","- The `SlidingWindowInferenceGenerator` class is a refined version of the original sliding window generator that properly handles:\n","  - Audio files shorter than the chunk duration by padding the audio to the required length and generating a single chunk starting at time 0.\n","  - Sliding windows over longer audio files with fixed steps and padding for any last partial chunks.\n","  - Normalization and mel spectrogram feature extraction consistent with training.\n","\n","- The generator yields batches of mel spectrogram features along with the filename and start times for the sliding windows.\n","\n","- The inference loop uses this generator to predict confidence scores for each chunk using the provided model and bird-specific label encoder.\n","\n","- The predicted probabilities above a threshold (0.5) are recorded with corresponding metadata, including start and end times, confidence scores, and labels.\n","\n","- The results are saved to a new CSV specifically covering these previously unprocessed shorter or missing files (`non_birdnet_confidences_from_softmax_short_files.csv`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","**In
