This allows the model to learn soft, split confidences while still framing the task as a multi-class problem.\n","- BirdNET pseudo labels were used as part of the training data to provide soft labels and expand coverage.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Results\n","\n","- The final model achieved an **overall accuracy of ~75%**.\n","- For the **non-BirdNET classes**, which are rarer and outside the main label sets, the model also maintained roughly **75.9% accuracy**.\n","- These metrics indicate strong reliability of the model for generating pseudo labels across many bird species, especially those underrepresented in existing large-scale analyzers.\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RM42rXaWGfdK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Imports**"],"metadata":{"id":"46WG_VZfDDOD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","import random\n","import warnings\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import librosa\n","import librosa.display\n","import soundfile as sf\n","import joblib\n","import ast\n","\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers, models\n","from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence, to_categorical\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2\n","from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy\n","from tensorflow.keras.metrics import CategoricalAccuracy\n","from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2\n","from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input as mobilenet_preprocess_input\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\n","from tensorflow.keras import mixed_precision\n","import tensorflow.keras.backend as K\n","\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\n","\n","from collections import Counter\n","from google.colab import drive\n","import zipfile\n","from tqdm import tqdm  # Import tqdm for progress bars and output writing\n","\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append('/content/drive/MyDrive/Main_Birdclef/scripts')\n","import birdclef_utils\n","\n","# Filter out UserWarnings from librosa related to PySoundFile/audioread\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", message=\"PySoundFile failed.

and the `RetreiveData` Class**\n","\n","This section describes the purpose and functionality of the `RetreiveData` class, which prepares data for training a bird classification model with a **softmax output** layer.\n","\n","The goal is to focus on samples with **only one bird species present**, which simplifies the classification task by excluding multi-bird or ambiguous samples. The class integrates multiple data sources and applies filtering to achieve this.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Overview of Data Sources and Their Roles\n","\n","- **`birdnet_train_labels_final.csv` (`self.start_time_info`)**  \n","  Contains BirdNET model predictions specifically for the **train_audio** dataset. These predictions correspond to BirdCLEF-assigned bird labels and include confidence scores and start times.\n","\n","- **`birdnet_soft_labels.csv` (`self.labeled_soundscapes`)**  \n","  Holds BirdCLEF model predictions for **soundscape audio** recordings. This dataset provides soft labels (probabilistic confidence values) for bird calls detected in longer and more complex audio segments.\n","\n","- **`birdnet_secondary_label_detections.csv` (`self.start_time_info_secondary_labels`)**  \n","  Contains BirdCLEF model confidence scores specifically for files that have secondary bird labels. These confidences correspond *only* to the secondary labels (Filtered Out).\n","\n","\n","- **`non_birdnet_start_time_and_soft_label_info.csv` (`self.start_time_info_two`)**  \n","  This file is for labels that are **not part of the BirdCLEF species classes**. These predictions were generated by a completely separate ResNet-based model trained from scratch, which used MFCC and mel spectrogram features. This dataset provides confidence scores (soft labels) and start time information for non-BirdCLEF species or background sounds.\n","\n","- **Non-BirdCLEF species labels (`non_birdnet_labels.npy`)**  \n","  A numpy array listing species labels outside of the BirdCLEF class set. These are integrated in the data retrieval step to handle non-standard labels.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Key Methods and Processing Logic\n","\n","### Filtering for single-bird samples\n","\n","To focus on samples with only one bird species, the method `get_one_label_soundscapes` filters the soundscape predictions, returning only those entries where exactly one bird call was detected for a given file and start time, and where the confidence is above a threshold of 0.30. This helps create cleaner, less ambiguous training targets for the softmax model.\n","\n","### Data Aggregation and Thresholding\n","\n","The class concatenates all label sources into a unified dataframe (`self.data`), including train audio labels, soundscape labels, secondary detections, and non-BirdCLEF labels.\n","\n","When retrieving data for a given file, the method `get_file_and_start_time`:\n","\n","1. Determines if the file corresponds to a BirdCLEF training bird or a soundscape.\n","2. Samples one relevant entry from the aggregated data for that filename.\n","3. Identifies the start time and retrieves all labels and confidence scores for the matching filename-start time window.\n","4. Applies species-specific confidence thresholds using the `apply_threshold` method to convert raw confidences into scaled or hard binary labels:\n","   - For **train_audio** files (i.e., those with assigned BirdCLEF labels), *all labels* present for that file are converted to **hard labels** (confidence set to 1.0) since we are confident those birds are present.\n","   - For **soundscape** files, confidence values are scaled or thresholded according to species-specific confidence thresholds. These thresholds are computed as the **lower quartile of BirdNET confidence scores** for each bird species in the train_audio dataset—representing a conservative estimate of the minimum confidence level observed for samples where the bird is known (or highly likely) to be present.\n","     - Specifically, the thresholds are calculated by grouping BirdNET confidences from the train_audio files by `primary_label` and taking the 25th percentile (lower quartile) of the confidence values for each species.\n","     - This approach helps to set adaptive, per-species thresholds that reflect real confidence distributions for known positive samples, thereby improving the reliability of pseudo-labeling on soundscape data.\n","\n","5. Returns the filename, primary labels, processed soft labels, start time, and file kind.\n","\n","---\n","\n","This carefully curated and filtered label data serves as reliable pseudo-labels for training a **softmax output** bird classification model, emphasizing single-bird audio segments from both training and soundscape datasets while also handling species outside the core BirdCLEF classes.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PUeNpvXqJFQD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":951,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756200262430,"user":{"displayName":"John
